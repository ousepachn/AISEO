## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Vision

To provide businesses with a simple and effective tool to understand and improve their online visibility in the age of AI-driven search and discovery. This webpage will offer a clear comparison of how a company's website is perceived by major AI models, providing actionable insights to enhance their digital presence.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

As AI language models like Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT become increasingly integrated into search and information discovery, businesses need to understand how these models interpret and rank their online content. There is currently no simple way for a non-technical user to quickly assess their "AI SEO" and get recommendations for improvement.

### 1.3 Target Audience

- **Small to Medium Business (SMB) Owners:** Individuals who manage their own online presence and need a quick, easy-to-understand assessment of their AI search ranking.
- **Marketing Professionals:** Marketers who want to optimize their clients' or company's websites for AI-driven search and need data to support their strategies.
- **SEO Specialists:** Experts looking to expand their service offerings to include AI optimization and need a tool for initial analysis.

## 3.0 Product Features

### 3.1 User Input

The user will be presented with a clean and simple interface to input the following information:

- **Website URL (Required):** The primary URL of the business website
- **Email Address (Optional):** An input field for the user to receive a PDF copy of their report
- **Industry (Optional):** A text field for the user to specify their industry (e.g., "Italian Restaurant," "Financial Advisor")
- **Location (Optional):** A text field for the user to enter their business's city and state/country
- **Services Offered (Optional):** A comma-separated list of specific services (e.g., "Wedding catering, corporate events, private parties")
- **"About Us" Page URL (Optional):** The direct link to their "About Us" or company information page

### 3.2 AI Search Comparison

The core feature of the service. After the user submits their information, the backend will query the following AI models with a standardized prompt (e.g., "Tell me about [website URL], a [industry] in [location]."):

- Gemini
- Claude
- ChatGPT

The results will be displayed in a side-by-side comparison, showing how each AI describes the business.

### 3.3 "About Us" Page Analysis

If the user provides an "About Us" page URL, the service will:

- Scrape the content from the "About Us" page
- Compare this content with the descriptions generated by the AI models
- Provide a similarity score or a summary of how well the AI descriptions match the company's own messaging

### 3.4 Sales Inquiry Simulation

The service will generate 2-3 realistic sales inquiries based on the user's provided industry and location. For example, for an "Italian Restaurant" in "New York, NY", an inquiry might be: "I'm looking for a good Italian restaurant in New York for a birthday dinner."

The service will then query each AI with these inquiries and display whether the user's business was recommended and the context of the recommendation.

### 3.5 SEO Analysis & Recommendations

The service will perform an automated technical SEO analysis of the user's website. This will be powered by the Google PageSpeed Insights API to generate a comprehensive score and will also include manual checks for other critical files.

The analysis will check for:

- **Performance Score:** A score (0-100) provided by the PageSpeed API for both mobile and desktop, indicating loading performance
- **SEO Score:** A score (0-100) from the PageSpeed API that checks for SEO best practices (e.g., viewport tag, title & meta description, legible font sizes)
- **Presence of robots.txt:** Check if a robots.txt file exists at the root of the domain. This file instructs search engines on how to crawl the site's pages
- **Presence of sitemap.xml:** Check for a sitemap, which helps search engines find and index content
- **Use of `<h1>` tags:** Verify that pages use a primary heading
- **Image Accessibility:** Check for the presence of alt attributes for images

Based on this analysis, the tool will provide a list of simple, actionable recommendations for improvement directly from the API results and our own checks.

### 3.6 PDF Report & Email Delivery

If a user provides their email address, the service will:

- Compile all the generated analysis sections (AI Comparison, About Us Analysis, Sales Inquiry Simulation, SEO Analysis) into a single, well-formatted PDF document
- Send this PDF as an email attachment to the provided address. This requires an email delivery service

- **Email/PDF Report Request Rate:** The percentage of users who provide an email to receive the report
